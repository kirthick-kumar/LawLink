Stephen: Hello, everyone. I need some legal advice regarding a situation with my college. They've raised the educational fees significantly, and I'm considering legal action. Any lawyers available to help?
Jefferson(Lawyer): Hi Stephen, I'm Jefferson. Let's take a look at the enrollment agreement and the circumstances surrounding the fee increase. Feel free to share any communication you've had with the college.
Stephen: Thanks, Jefferson. I have some emails and letters. It's been a bit of a dead-end trying to resolve this with the college directly.
Jefferson(Lawyer): You can book a consultation with me to discuss these details next week, you contact me through the details that I have mentioned in my profile.
Stephen: Thanks for responding Jefferson, but I would prefer if this was addressed as soon as possible, so I cannot wait for a week.
Jefferson(Lawyer): No problem Stephen, I hope your issues get resolved and I am always available to book consultations.
Rick(Lawyer): Hi Stephen, contact me through the details in my profile, and we can discuss the details about the case privately within this week.
